# genshin-web

This project was bootstrapped using [next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/).

### Prerequisites

- [Node.JS 14+](https://nodejs.org/)
- [yarn 2+](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Local development

To start a local development instance at: http://localhost:3000

```shell
# Install dependencies
yarn

# Start next.js dev server
yarn dev
```

## Production build

To start a production instance at: http://0.0.0.0:3000

```shell
# Install dependencies
yarn

# Compile project and static assets
yarn build

# Start next.js prod server
yarn start
```

This website uses `getServerSideProps` extensively, so it cannot be served by a static file server.

Refer to the [Dockerfile](../Dockerfile.web) which is a more advanced production build script.

## Environment variables

Compile-time variables:

- (optional) `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_PUBLIC` URL of the `sync` server that is accessible from the internet.
- (optional) `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_INTERNAL` URL of the `sync` server that is accessible within the local network. This can be useful when running on Docker because requests will be handled faster. e.g. if the API service is named `genshin-sync`, set as `http://genshin-sync:5000`. Falls back to `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_PUBLIC` when not specified.

This project interacts with the [sync](../sync) server by communicating through a RESTful HTTP API. Unless `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_PUBLIC` is configured, the official API provided by [seekr.pw](https://genshin.seekr.pw/api/v1) is used by default. This makes development simpler because you do not need to run Postgres and `sync` locally.
